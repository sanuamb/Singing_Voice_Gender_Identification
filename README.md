# Singing_Voice_Gender_Identification

1. Singing voice differs in pitch compared to normal speech hence detecting singing voice characteristics 
such as gender,age and height is challenging to have singers metadata. We have taken smule sing! karaoke dataset 
to predict gender of a given singing voice.
2. For features we have extracted MFCC and timbre features. Timbre features help us to know the brightness and 
pitch of individual singing voice. Trained DNN and LSTM on these features to predict the singing voice gender.
